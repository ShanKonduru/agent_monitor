# Docker Network Troubleshooting Guide

The error you're seeing indicates a network connectivity issue with Docker Hub. Here are several solutions:

## Solution 1: Check Docker Desktop Settings

1. **Open Docker Desktop** 
2. Go to **Settings** → **Resources** → **Network**
3. Try changing DNS settings:
   - Use: `8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4` (Google DNS)
   - Or: `1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1` (Cloudflare DNS)

## Solution 2: Configure Docker Proxy (if behind corporate firewall)

1. In Docker Desktop Settings → **Resources** → **Proxies**
2. Enable manual proxy configuration if needed
3. Or try disabling proxy if currently enabled

## Solution 3: Use Alternative Base Images

Instead of `python:3.11-slim`, try these alternatives that might be cached:

```dockerfile
# Try these alternatives in order:
FROM python:3.11
FROM python:3.10-slim  
FROM python:latest
FROM alpine:latest
```

## Solution 4: Use Local Python Installation

Create a Dockerfile that uses the host Python:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
# Use host Python through volume mount
```

## Solution 5: Docker Build with Different Registry

Try using a different registry:

```bash
# Microsoft Container Registry
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=mcr.microsoft.com/python:3.11-slim

# GitHub Container Registry  
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/python/python:3.11-slim
```

## Solution 6: Offline Docker Build

If you have the image cached elsewhere:

```bash
# Save image from another machine
docker save python:3.11-slim > python-3.11-slim.tar

# Load on this machine
docker load < python-3.11-slim.tar
```

## Solution 7: Use Docker Desktop's Built-in Images

Check what's available locally:

```bash
docker images
docker search python
```

## For Immediate Demo

Since we're having network issues, let's proceed with:
1. **Local Multi-Agent Demo** (ready to run)
2. **Docker concepts demonstration** 
3. **Complete setup guide** for when connectivity is restored

Would you like to run the local container simulation demo now?
