# Minimal Container Agent - Using BusyBox (ultra-minimal)
FROM busybox:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Note: BusyBox doesn't have Python, so this would need a different approach
# This is just for testing connectivity

# Copy agent file (though it won't run without Python)
COPY simple_container_agent.py .

# For demo purposes - would normally need Python runtime
CMD ["echo", "BusyBox container running - Python runtime needed for agent"]
